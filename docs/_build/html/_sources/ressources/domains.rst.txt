   :description lang=en: Install,Hive,Infraestructure.


Hive is the main Operations Server of Siesta Time. Is the first element that needs to be deployed.
The user has the option to do it "Online", or using terraform to deploy Hive with target Virtual Private Cloud.
Configurations of target VPC t use will be saved in a txt fyle by the syntax of: ``./SiestaTime/installconfig/config<VPC>.txt``
There is the option to deploy without using a VPC, or ``Offline``, this will install Hive in the curent host.


What this does? What is Hive?
------------------------------

Hive is the main “Operation Server”. Hive will receive every command/job from authenticated clients and process or redirect them to a target foothold.
The main DB of siesta time will be in this server, with all information/configurations from the red team operators’ actions.

* Install in the instalator's system dependencies (gcc,apache utils,...)
* Parse config<VPC>.txt file, use the parameters for creating a hive.tf (terraform plan)
* Download Go and the required dependencies to compile Hive. Compile it.
* Create sqlite DB
* Dowload Terraform and apply plan

In the same way, the hive.tf plan will (and this will be performed in the same host if Offline):

* Install Hive OS/Distro. dependencies
* Download go and their dependencies, to be able to compile Implants
* Download Terraform and terraform plugins
* Create ``/usr/local/STHive`` folder structure
* Upload OS dependencies, keys, DB, compiled Hive binary ...
* Configure Hive as a service





Online - AWS
----------------

**Steps to Prepare AWS Servers**

* Find EC2 Information
    * Prepare AWS key and credentials for target VPC
    * AccessKey/SecretKey
    * EC2 → “My Security Credentials” → “Access Keys”
    * `ami`_ 
    * `region`_ 
    * Create key pair on target region and Download “.pem” key


* Complete ``SiestaTime/installConfig/configAWS.txt``

::

    USERNAME : Admin Username
    PASSWORD : Admin password
    port : HTTPS Hive port listener
    accesskey: AWS accesskey
    secretkey: AWS secretkey
    Region: AWS region
    Keyname: AWS keyname (without .pem)
    ami: aws ami 
    itype: AWS ec2 itype

* Copy AWS key to ``SiestaTime/installConfig/<keyname>.pem``

* Run 

.. prompt:: bash $

    ./hive.sh installaws

Offline
-----------
Offline option let operators to install hive in a target host without the use of terraform or any kind of VPC credentials.

.. prompt:: bash $

    ./hive.sh installOffline



.. note::
    Every installing option come with a "No Darwin" version of it. This will let hive to work without the need of Darwin dependencies (but loosing MacOSX implant abilities)

.. prompt:: bash $

    ./hive.sh installawsNoDarwin
    ./hive.sh installOfflineNoDarwin
    [...]

Uninstall
-----------

.. prompt:: bash $

    ./hive.sh remove

.. warning:: When installed Offline remove will not erase created/configured host data and packages
